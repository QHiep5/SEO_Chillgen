## Findings

- No CRITICAL or MAJOR content issue found in B030 after live PDP and image review.
- Auto-check `non-slip` warnings were resolved by live meta/page text and feature/backing images showing non-slip/anti-slip backing.
- Auto-check `identity_status` warnings were downgraded to LIMITATION: storefront identity is confirmed, but admin/export before-state is still required before approval or deployment.
- Keyword evidence is suitable for content QA but remains `SERP_ONLY`: no paid volume, direct Chillgen Search Console, internal search, or customer review evidence was provided.

## Next Step

Review the limitations before approval/deploy. If accepted, B030 can move to human content approval; otherwise add admin export and stronger demand evidence, then re-QA the affected fields.
